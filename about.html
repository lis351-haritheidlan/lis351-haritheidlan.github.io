			<dt><b>Profile</b></dt>
				<dd>I am from Johor, the southernmost state in <b>Malaysia</b>, one of the countries in Southeast Asia. It is better known as the neighboring country of Singapore because they are rich and developed.</dd>
				<dd>I love <b>experimenting stuff and doing on hands work</b>, and maybe that explains my passion in engineering. Also, my father is also an engineer and my role model, which might relate to my interest in engineering.</dd>
				<dd>I aspire to be a <b>well rounded person</b>, not very into academics like a bookworm, and not really into sports like an athlete. I like to find balance in life because as people say, <i>"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."</i></dd>
			
			<dt><b>Studies & Interests</b></dt>
				<dd>I am currently in my <b>third year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</b>. I am majoring in <b>Chemical Engineering</b>, and could understand why it is ranked as one of the hardest majors, at least by the thought of other students.</dd>
				<dd>I <b>considered to pursue my career in culinary</b>, and plan to be a widely known chef like Gordon Ramsay, owning multiple restaurants. I have a huge passion in cooking, and eager to try new recipes. Giving people dishes that I've made means a lot to me. However, I realized that it requires more popularity and networking than skills, and decided that STEM might be a better and safer choice for me.</dd>
			
			<dt><b>Hobbies & Sports</b></dt>
				<dd>I try to balance myself between activities related to <b>technology and nature</b> when I have leisure time. I enjoy <b>playing video games</b> and <b>watch technological-related content</b> on YouTube, especially those from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips" target="_blank">Linus Tech Tips</a>.</dd>
				<dd>Similarly, I like spending my time outdoors. <b>Cycling</b> is one of my favorite things to do, especially in Madison which is known for its bicycle friendliness. During longer free time such as academic breaks, I love to go <b>hiking</b>. Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Rocky Mountain, and Devil's Lake are some of the parks that I have been to.</dd>
				<dd>I am quite good in <b>badminton and futsal</b>, and used to represent my high school in the district-level badminton tournament. Also, I used to play <b>rugby</b> as a flanker, but not in the United States since the difference in size is a big obstacle for me.</dd>
