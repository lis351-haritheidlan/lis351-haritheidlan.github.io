		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;">With the help of 7 other individuals including my fellow researchmates, supervisors, and mentors, I have conducted a research titled <i>The Insecticide Activity of Latex from Hevea Brasiliensis on Metisa Plana.</i>
		We published the research paper and became gold medalists in the 2018 International Future Scientists Conference.

		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Rubber tree and palm oil plantations are two of the largest industries in Malaysia. They promote the export of raw materials like rubber and oil to other countries, boosting the economic growth.
		Latex harvested from the commnon rubber tree, <i>Hevea Brasiliensis</i>, can be turned into rubber using appropriate methods to seperate the rubber molecules from the other liquids. Similarly, palm oil seeds
		are harvested when mature, and transported to processing plants to be turned into useful products such as cooking oil, soap, and others.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;">However, <i>Metisa Plana</i>, or widely known as bagworms, are a major threat to the palm oil industry since it can infect the plantations and reduce yields by up to 40%. Plants have their own self defence
		mechanism, including the secretion of latex. Other than healing properties, latex has been found to repel insects to protect the plants. Since rubber does not have insecticide properties, we hypothesized
		that the insect repelling subtances are contained inside the liquid left after the rubber coagulates and collected, which from now on will be called the <i>serum</i>. </p>
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;">An idea was born: spraying the serum onto the leaves of palm oil plants to combat the outbreak of bagworms. To test this, we applied different concentrations of the serum onto several palm oil leaves. Then, we 
		collected several specimens of the bagworms and put a few of them onto each leaves for them to consume.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;">The results support our theory. We found that higher concentrations of the serum reduce the extent that the bagworms eat the leaves, but higher concentrations also seem to intervene with the leaves growth and respiration,
		causing them to be dead. A serum concentration of somewhat in the middle between two extremes was the best since the leaves with the serum applied onto them have no holes while still being alive and healthy.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;">We hope that our research opened new possibilities and ideas to take advantage of the two large industries in Malaysia. Future development might be done to continue the research on this topic.</p>
